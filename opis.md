### 1. What is Challengify?

Challengify is a platform where short, creative "micro-challenges" are published daily (or at user-selected intervals) across various categories:

- **Creative Writing** (e.g., write a 100-word story fragment)
- **Mobile Photography** (take a themed photo: shadow, reflection in water, etc.)
- **DIY & Crafts** (create a simple item from recycled materials)
- **Healthy Habit of the Day** (e.g., 5 minutes of meditation, try a new healthy snack)
- **Practical Skills** (e.g., learn 3 phrases in a foreign language, make your own cosmetic)

Each day, one micro-challenge appears in each category. Users have 24 hours to complete the task and submit their response (photo, description, short video, or link). After the time is up, the community votes for the most interesting entries, awarding badges and reputation points to the authors.

### 2. Why is it engaging and unique?

1. **A Daily Dose of Inspiration**
    - Users receive simple but creative ideas for small actions, building the habit of "visiting the site" every day.
    - The short challenges don't take much time (max 15â€“30 minutes), making them accessible to a wide audience (students, working people, parents).

2. **Community and Gamification**
    - Points and badges system: participants level up, unlock new challenge categories, and can compete in weekly "championships."
    - Comments and voting: encourages interaction and relationship-building.
    - User profiles with achievements: motivate regular participation.

3. **Variety of Categories**
    - The topics change daily, so it's hard to get bored.
    - Possibility to create custom themed weeks (e.g., zero-waste week, literary week, photography week), which can be proposed and joined by moderators or the community.

4. **User-generated Content**
    - All content (photos, descriptions, videos) comes from users, eliminating the need to invest in professional content.
    - Initial moderation (community feedback, reports) can be partially automated over time (e.g., keyword filters, crowdsourced flagging of inappropriate content).
